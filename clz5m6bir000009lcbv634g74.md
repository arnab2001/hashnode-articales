## The Problem

Maintaining a deep understanding of a complex codebase is a constant challenge in any development team. This complexity is amplified in larger projects, where code evolves rapidly, and documentation may lag behind. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a new joiner, navigating through extensive code can be time-consuming and sometimes frustrating. Questions like `"What does this function do?"`, `"Where is this class used?"`, or `"How do these modules interact?"` often require digging through layers of code and documentation.

For new team members, this challenge is even more pronounced. The onboarding process, while crucial, can be slow and overwhelming as they familiarize themselves with the project's intricacies. Mentoring from senior developers is invaluable but can divert their attention from critical tasks, impacting the team's overall productivity.

However, even experienced developers can find themselves lost in a sea of code when revisiting less familiar parts of the project. Every team member, regardless of their tenure, faces moments of uncertainty where they need quick and reliable answers about the codebase.

## The Solution

This is where [**codecompass.ai**](https://github.com/chhakuli123/code-compass) steps in, revolutionizing how teams interact with their code. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, codecompass.ai acts as an intelligent assistant that provides immediate, accurate answers to any code-related query. Imagine being able to ask, "How is this function connected to other parts of the system?" and receiving a comprehensive, clear response within seconds.  
This is how it all works, We will discuss the inner workings little bit later in the blog:

## How We Built It

Building [codecompass.ai](https://github.com/chhakuli123/code-compass) was an exciting journey that involved careful planning, selecting the right technologies, overcoming challenges, and meticulous coding. Here’s a brief overview of the key steps we took to bring this innovative tool to life.

### 1\. Planning

Me (Arnab Chatterjee) and Chhakuli Zingare began brainstorming with a clear goal: to create something that would make a real difference for developers. We reflected on our early days as junior developers, recalling the countless hours spent trying to understand complex codebases. This shared experience sparked the idea for codecompass.ai—a tool designed to make navigating code easier for everyone.

With this inspiration, we dove into planning sessions. Our initial meetings were filled with energy and excitement as we brainstormed potential features, discussed the user flow, and debated the best technology stack to bring our vision to life. We sketched out our ideas on an Excalidraw screen, mapping out how codecompass[.ai](http://codecompass.ai) could transform the development process.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1722097132349/8538664b-2d19-44dc-ab61-74dda52fc413.png align="center")

### 2\. Choosing The Tech Stack

Choosing the right tech stack was crucial to bringing our vision for [codecompass.ai](http://codecompass.ai) to life. We needed technologies that were robust, scalable, and could integrate seamlessly to provide a smooth user experience.

For the backend, we opted to use **OpenAI** API for vector embedding and large language models (LLMs). The OpenAI API provided the advanced natural language processing capabilities we needed to accurately understand and respond to code-related queries.

We used **Pinecone** for efficient **vector storage** and retrieval, ensuring fast and accurate access to our data. **LangChainJS** was incorporated to manage and streamline interactions with the **LLM**, making the integration process more efficient and reliable.

On the frontend, we chose **Next.js** for its powerful features and seamless integration with our backend. To create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface, we used **ShadCN** and **Tailwind CSS**. These tools allowed us to design a user-friendly interface that enhances productivity and user engagement.

### 3\. Hurdle

One of the significant challenges we faced was pulling a GitHub repository and transforming it into a format that our LLM could effectively read and interpret. Initially, we struggled with the unstructured data and JSON formats, which didn't yield good results when processed by the LLM.

To overcome this, we developed our own logic to convert the repository data into a structured text document. This structured format allowed the LLM to understand the code better and provide more accurate and contextual responses. We stored this structured data in Pinecone, indexing it by file path to ensure efficient retrieval.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Plain Text:
[DIR_START]src 
[FILE_START]src/index.js
// File content here
[FILE_END]src/index.js
[FILE_START]src/utils.js 
// File content here 
[FILE_END]src/utils.js 
[DIR_END]src
This format clearly shows:
- Directory structure ([DIR_START] and [DIR_END])
- File locations and contents ([FILE_START] and [FILE_END])
- Preservation of code and text exactly as it appears in the repository
```

As part of this solution, **we created an npm package** called [**git-repo-parser**](https://github.com/arnab2001/git-repo-parser). This package pulls data from GitHub and transforms it into an LLM-friendly text format. You can find the package at [GitHub](https://github.com/arnab2001/git-repo-parser) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-repo-parser). This tool has been crucial in making codecompass.ai effective and reliable for users.

### 4\. Coding

The coding phase of codecompass was a collaborative effort, with each of us focusing on different critical components to bring the project to life.

Chhakuli started by building the homepage, ensuring it was both welcoming and functional.

![Homepage of out Codecompass](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1722173370651/1654f774-07d7-4720-aae6-446e9f1ac143.png align="center")

Meanwhile,I began working on the backend, focusing on reading a GitHub repository and storing the data in a structured format, feeding it to open ai API to generate vector embedding, and sending it to our vector database. This involved proper chunking of the data to ensure efficient retrieval and processing.

![Flow for Turing Codebases into Pinecone Db Vector embeddings](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1722100686626/b0401bef-e2b6-43d2-9079-45501f6224c6.png align="center")

As Chhakuli moved on to developing the chat screen, I concentrated on implementing the logic to retrieve data from the vector database. This was crucial for producing accurate and contextual responses, complete with citations to the source code.

![Vector Search and Answer Generation flow](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1722104710872/1290d327-d1f4-4f42-8c2a-d21c1e37ec3c.png align="center")

This diagram represents the architecture responsible for processing the user's question, leveraging chat history, and an initial prompt, and retrieving relevant information from the Pinecone vector database to generate a well-crafted response.

The process begins with the user submitting a question, which includes context from the chat history. This question and its context are then transformed into a vector representation using a vector embedding model.

The vector representation is queried against the Pinecone vector database, which returns the top 5 most relevant results.

These results are used to create a comprehensive context for the user's question. If needed, this context is further refined to generate a new, more specific question. The refined context and question are then processed by the Large Language Model (LLM), which generates a detailed answer, citing sources as necessary.

This answer is delivered back to the user, ensuring that codecompass.ai provides accurate, contextually relevant, and well-cited responses to user queries, enhancing the overall productivity and efficiency of development teams.

Afterward, my focus shifted to fine-tuning the LLM. This involved tweaking the code and refining the prompts to ensure the AI could accurately read and point to the correct file paths within the codebase and @[Chhakuli Zingare](@chhakuli) worked on Refactoring the codebase and adding style and design to the chat page. Our combined efforts in these areas were essential in creating a seamless and efficient user experience for codecompass.

So this is how the Chat screen looks like:
