[Socialite](https://github.com/arnab2001/socialite) , my passion project of a social media app, was missing something - the option of real-time interaction! It's time to build a chat feature, and Node.js is our trusty steed. Let's embark on this coding adventure!

**The Challenge:** Building a fast, real-time chat experience for Socialite's users.

**The Weapon:** [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) - a powerful library for bi-directional communication between server and client.

**The Shield:** MongoDB - our reliable data fortress for storing messages and user information.

**The Spice:** Caching - the secret ingredient for speedy performance!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703879483265/4299b98d-edcc-4697-a692-6aef0fc7a8b5.png align="center")

**Setting the Stage:**

1. **Building the Server:** Express.js, our trusty framework, lays the foundation. A [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) server listens for incoming connections and orchestrates the chat symphony.
    
2. **Connecting the Dots:** Clients join chat rooms with their user IDs. We use these IDs to fetch chat history and send messages to the right recipients.
    
3. **Chat History Cache:** Enter the hero, the chat history cache! This in-memory store temporarily holds recently accessed conversations, ensuring lightning-fast retrieval for frequently requested data. Why? MongoDB lookups aren't instant, and frequent database calls can bog things down. The cache acts as a bridge, minimizing those trips and keeping the conversation flowing smoothly.
    
4. **Active Users on the Radar:** We keep track of online users using a simple map. When a user joins, they're added to the map, and when they leave, they gracefully exit. This map helps us notify everyone about who's available to chat, keeping the social flame alight.
    
5. **Message Relay:** When a message is sent, First, it's saved in the trusty MongoDB for posterity. Then, it zooms through the network, finding the recipient's connected socket (thanks to the active users map) and delivering the message in real time. No need for constant polling or anxious refreshes - instant gratification, here we come!
    

**Why Caching tho? :** Imagine your friends bombarding you with memes right after lunch. Every request would send you running to the fridge. But if you had a snack tray readily available, things would be much smoother, right? That's what the chat history cache does. Frequently accessed messages are readily available in-memory, saving precious database calls and delivering smooth, responsive chat experiences.

## Building the Chat Architecture: **Event-Driven Architecture and Key Events**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703879537489/a15796c8-fbc2-4c1e-98b8-2bd282cf07f4.png align="center")

let's dive deeper into the heart of real-time communication: **Socket events**. These events act as cues for specific actions, orchestrating the flow of information and driving the dynamic chat experience.

**Key Events and their Roles:**

1. **join\_chat:** This event fires when a user enters a chat room. The server receives the event, adds the user to the room's participant list, and broadcasts their arrival to all existing participants. This ensures everyone knows who's online and ready to chat.
    
2. **send\_message:** When a user types and sends a message, this event triggers. The server captures the message content, sender information, and recipient(s), saves it to MongoDB for permanent storage, and then utilizes [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) to deliver it directly to the intended recipient(s) in real-time.
    
3. **receive\_message:** This event acts as the receiver's side of the "send\_message" event. When a user receives a message, their browser receives this event, displaying the message on their chat interface, keeping them in the loop of the conversation.
    
4. **leave\_chat:** When a user exits a chat room, this event informs the server. The server removes the user from the participant list and broadcasts their departure to other members, ensuring everyone is aware of who's still in the room.
    
5. **typing\_indicator:** This optional event can be implemented to provide real-time typing feedback. When a user starts typing, a "typing\_indicator" event can be emitted, notifying other participants in the room that they can expect a message soon.
    

These are just some core events in Socialite's chat architecture. Depending on your specific needs, you can implement additional events to handle group chats, private messages, notifications, and other features.

**Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture:**

* **Responsiveness:** Events allow for immediate reactions to user actions, leading to a more responsive and fluid chat experience.
    
* **Decoupling:** Events decouple components of the chat system, making them more modular and easier to maintain.
    
* **Scalability:** Event-driven architecture can handle increased traffic and workload more efficiently than traditional request-response models.
    

**Considerations for Event Design:**

* **Event naming:** Choose descriptive and consistent event names for clarity and ease of understanding.
    
* **Event parameters:** Use parameters to pass relevant information within an event, ensuring the server has the necessary data to react appropriately.
    
* **Error handling:** Implement robust error handling for event transmission and processing to ensure smooth operation.
    

## Time To Code! **Diving into the Server-Side**

It's time to venture into the engine room of Socialite's chat feature and witness the code that makes real-time conversations possible. We'll dive into the server-side implementation, exploring key functions and how they coordinate to bring messages to life.

### **Setting the Stage: Server Setup**

```javascript
import express from "express";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import cors from "cors";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { Server } from "socket.io";
import {
  handleChatConnection,
  setIoInstance,
} from "./controllers/chatController.js";

dotenv.config();
const app = express();
const server = createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);
app.use(cors());

// Set Socket.IO instance
setIoInstance(io);

// Chat connection handling
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  handleChatConnection(socket);
});

// Mongoose connection
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGO_URL, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => {
    server.listen(process.env.PORT || 3001, () => console.log("Server running"));
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error.message));
```

* **Imports:** Imports necessary libraries for server setup, middleware, and chat functionality.
    
* **Configs:** Loads environment variables using `dotenv`.
    
* **App instance:** Creates an Express app instance.
    
* **Server and** [**Socket.IO**](http://Socket.IO)**:** Creates an HTTP server and a [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) instance for real-time communication.
    
* **Middleware:** Uses CORS middleware to enable cross-origin requests.
    
* [**Socket.IO**](http://Socket.IO) **setup:**
    
    * Sets the [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) instance using `setIoInstance`.
        
    * Listens for new connections and handles them using `handleChatConnection`.
        
* **Mongoose connection:**
    
    * Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
        
    * Starts the server after a successful connection.
        

### Setting up the Store: The Message Model

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const messageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  senderId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  recipientId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  message: { type: String, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

const Message = mongoose.model('Message', messageSchema);

export default Message;
```

* **Import Mongoose:** Brings in the Mongoose library for interacting with MongoDB.
    
* **Define Message Schema:** Creates a schema that outlines the structure of each message document:
    
    * `senderId`: The MongoDB ObjectId of the message sender, referencing a user in the User collection.
        
    * `recipientId`: The MongoDB ObjectId of the message recipient, also referencing a user.
        
    * `message`: The text content of the message.
        
    * `createdAt`: The timestamp when the message was created, automatically set to the current date and time.
        
* **Export Message Model:** Exports the Mongoose model named `Message`, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
    

**Note:**

* **Relationships:** The `ref` property in `senderId` and `recipientId` establishes links to the User collection, enabling efficient retrieval of user information alongside messages.
    
* **Timestamps:** The `createdAt` field facilitates chronological ordering of messages and potential time-based features like message history viewing and sorting.
    

## **Orchestrating Connections and Conversations: The Chat Controller**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703879646651/1e48a0a4-032a-4d0c-9aff-78f12a8e5efe.png align="center")

Now, let's venture into the heart of the chat functionality, where connections are established, messages are exchanged, and users gracefully depart. The chat controller expertly directs this symphony of real-time interactions:

```javascript
import Message from "./../models/Message.js";

const activeUsers = new Map(); // Stores active user sockets and IDs
const chatHistoryCache = new Map(); // Caches chat history for performance

let ioInstance; // Holds the Socket.IO instance for use in functions

// Sets the Socket.IO instance for use within the controller
export const setIoInstance = (io) => {
  ioInstance = io;
};

// Handles incoming chat connections
export const handleChatConnection = (socket) => {
  console.log(`Socket connected: ${socket.id}`);

  // Join chat room and emit chat history
  socket.on("join_chat", async ({ userId }) => {
    try {
      socket.join(userId); // Joins the chat room with the user's ID

      // Check cache first for chat history
      const cachedHistory = chatHistoryCache.get(userId);

      if (cachedHistory) {
        socket.emit("chat_history", cachedHistory);
      } else {
        // Fetch chat history from database if not cached
        const chatHistory = await Message.find({
          $or: [{ senderId: userId }, { recipientId: userId }],
        }).sort({ createdAt: "asc" });

        socket.emit("chat_history", chatHistory);
        chatHistoryCache.set(userId, chatHistory); // Update cache
      }

      // Add user to active users map and emit updated list
      activeUsers.set(socket.id, { userId, socket });
      ioInstance.emit(
        "active_users",
        [...activeUsers.values()].map((user) => user.userId)
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error joining chat:", error);
    }
  });

  // Handles incoming messages
  socket.on("send_message", async ({ senderId, recipientId, message }) => {
    try {
      // Create a new message in the database
      const newMessage = await Message.create({
        senderId,
        recipientId,
        message,
      });

      // Find recipient's socket if online and emit message directly
      const recipientSocket = [...activeUsers.values()].find(
        (user) => user.userId === recipientId
      )?.socket;

      if (recipientSocket) {
        recipientSocket.emit("receive_message", {
          senderId,
          message: newMessage.message,
          createdAt: newMessage.createdAt,
        });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error creating message:", error);
    }
  });

  // Handles socket disconnections
  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    console.log(`Socket disconnected: ${socket.id}`);

    activeUsers.delete(socket.id); // Remove user from active users map

    // Emit updated list of active users
    ioInstance.emit(
      "active_users",
      [...activeUsers.values()].map((user) => user.userId)
    );
  });
};
```
